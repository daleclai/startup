# Tap-a-Lot

[My Notes](notes.md)

A game website where you tap a button, earn points for each click, and compete with friends. You can exchange points for different button skins and backgrounds. Create an account (email and name) to store scores and skins and so your name can be ranked on the website. Rankings show ranking, name, and points (diff colors). There will be three tabs, "Tap", "Store", and "Rankings" on the bottom and a 'settings' tab in the top right corner.

### Key features

- Login over HTTPS
- Each tap adds a point
- Use points to buy button skins and backgrounds (will subtract from total points)
- Ability to store and use bought skins.
- People who create accounts can see other account names, points, and rankings.
- Save points, skins, and ranking using name and email

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Four HTML pages. Use hyperlinks to move between them. One for the main page with the tapping button. Another to view and use the store to buy skins. Another to view rankings. Lastly, one to create/login and see your account.
- **CSS** - Style each page that can be used on different sceens. Uses good styling to look like a game app.
- **React** - Provides login, use points, and save taps as points.
- **Service** - Used for backend such as login accounts, make taps/points functional, rank accourding to points, and adding/subracting points.
- **DB/Login** - Store usernames, points, rankings, and 'skin' images. Accounts saved so people can save their points. 
- **WebSocket** - Every tap is saved and automatically applies to ranking for other users to see.
